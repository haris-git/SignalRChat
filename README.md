# SignalRChat
This is a .NET chat application. SignalR and Javascript are used. Run the solution with Visual studio and open at least two web browser windows.
Think of each browser as a different client. If you send a message from one browser(client), it will appear immediatelly inside the other ones.

This project was created with Visual Studio 2019, as a new ASP.NET Core Web Application with ASP.NET Core 3.1. 
Also, I have installed the Client-Side Library @microsoft/signalr@3.1.8 inside the wwwroot/js folder.
